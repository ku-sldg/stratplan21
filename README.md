# ITTC Strategic Planning 2021

Home for documentation associated with ITTC's 2021 Strategic Planning activity.  Visit the wiki link above to see the ongoing plan as it is updated.

Our goals are to:

0. Restructure ITTC as an Institute with multiple Centers much like other designated KU research centers.
1. Decide what it is we want to become over the next 10 years.
2. Establish measurable goals for getting where we want to be.
3. Identify resources needed to achieve our goals.

The process for our planning is:

0. A preliminary structure will be provided to begin the discussion.
1. An initial draft will be created by a small group of senior faculty and staff that describes our high level goals and organizational structure.
2. The initial draft will be discussed, changed, improved by all ITTC PIs and Staff.
3. Individual Centers within the Institute will engage in their own planning activities lead by their Directors.

There are a number of non-negotiables in this process:

0. ITTC will retain its culture.
1. ITTC services will not be diminished.
2. We will be aspirational.
